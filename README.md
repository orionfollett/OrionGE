# H1 Library Structure:

<p>This project is mainly a loosely coupled collection of C++ header files that 
offers solutions to common functionality that games require. </p>

<p>They are not huge files covering every edge case of game design. Instead they are the bare minimum that is relatively easy
to understand if you just read the code, and don't overwhelm you with options. </p>

<p> This is a personal project for me, so that I don't have to rewrite optimized OpenGL code
  every time I want to draw a cube on the screen. </p>
